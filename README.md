# Welcome to BeanieODM!

## About BeanieODM
BeanieODM is the official home for the Beanie and Bunnet projects. Our organization is focused on developing innovative database management tools that are designed to integrate seamlessly with Python.

### Projects
- **[Beanie](https://github.com/BeanieODM/beanie)**: An asynchronous ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for MongoDB, allowing developers to manage their database with Pythonic models and asynchronous operations. For more details, visit [Beanie documentation](https://beanie-odm.dev/).
- **[Bunnet](https://github.com/BeanieODM/bunnet)**: A synchronous version of Beanie that facilitates database operations without the asynchronous programming model, perfect for applications that require traditional synchronous database interactions.
